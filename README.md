# cronSchedulerTransformer
This repository converts cron expressions like "01 13 * * 3,4" into human-readable strings such as "At 13:01 on Wednesday and Thursday." It handles arrays of cron schedules, supports wildcards (`*` for daily), and formats multiple days for easier understanding of cron jobs.
